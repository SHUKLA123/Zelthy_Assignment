I have participated in National Level Hackathon where I have to lead my team. It was my first ever experience in leading the team. 
I have to win that hackathon. So, I decided to manage the work to all team member that others don't feel that as workload. I make them motivated throughout the hackathon at every stage.
After 2 days we have secured 2 ranks in that hackathon.
